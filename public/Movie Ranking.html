    <h1>Top 3 "Irfan Khan's" Movie Review</h1>
    <h2>The Best Movies Of All Time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Paan Singh Tomar (2012)</h3>
    <p>Khan scored a major lead role in the 2012 biopic of Paan Singh Tomar, a soldier and national steeplechase champion. Once his glittering athletic career had ended (after putting him in a Catch-22 situation where competing in sport meant he could no longer fight as a soldier), he returned home to resolve a village dispute over land with a relative, but attempts to get help from the police lead nowhere, and Tomar ultimately took matters into his own hands. The dispute rages on, and Tomar turns to extortion, kidnapping, and murder. He agrees to give an interview with a local newspaper, which eventually leads to his downfall, and Tomar is killed along with his gang in a police shootout.</p>
    <h3>The Lunchbox (2013)</h3>
    <p>This is an exquisite gem of a film, and was Khan's highest grossing Hindi film until it was surpassed by Hindi Medium. Khan is Saajan, a lonely widower surprised one day at his accounting job by the delivery of a lunchbox. (The Indian dabbawala sees the organized daily delivery of lunchboxes to office workers after picking them up at the workers' homes or at restaurants.) It turns out to be a misdelivery from an unhappy young wife, Ila. Saajan sends a note back explaining the mistake, but the lunches keep coming, and he and Ila develop a friendship through daily messages. It's a tender, tentative, chaste relationship full of unspoken longing, and the open-ended ending might frustrate some viewers, but Khan delivers a truly beautiful, subtle performance of a quietly heartbroken man who might have one more chance at happiness. Not to be missed.</p>
    <h3>Slumdog Millionaire (2008)</h3>
    <p>Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire was a bona fide international hit, and Khan has a memorable role as the nameless police inspector trying to figure out if Dev Patel's Jamal has cheated on a game show or not, inevitably deciding that he couldn't have and letting him go back to finish the episode. The transparency of Khan's acting is so finely honed here, you can almost see his mind changing from being convinced of Jamal's guilt to backing his innocence. After world-renown crested the horizon for a cast that was largely unknown in the English-speaking world, Boyle said of Khan and his chances of success in both English/American and Indian films, “He is a touchstone connecting two worlds.”</p>
